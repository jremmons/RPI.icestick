**Why is this interesting/useful/worthwhile**: Small, inexpensive development
boards such as the Raspberry Pi and iCEstick FPGA have taken over the world of
hobbyist computing. Their popularity has led to the formation of burgeoning
communities that donate their time and expertise to making these devices easy to
the use and extensible. For these reasons, these devices have become an integral
part of many computer science curricula and are the best choice for non-experts
looking to get start in hardware.

However, while these devices are easier to use than most other computer
hardware, support for more complex tasks is limited. In particular, softare and
hardware interfaces for communication between devices via standards like SPI and
I2C is not provided by default. This severely limits the ability of non-experts
to combine their devices.

**What is the end result**: The goal of RPI.icestick is to provide the
infrastructure necessary for communicating between software running on the
Raspberry Pi and hardware programmed on iCEstick FPGA via their GPIO pins (using
SPI).
